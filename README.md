# doppl-rs

This project is a simulation of the Doppler effect using Bevy and Rust to
animate. The Doppler effect is responsible for frequency change in sound you
can hear when a car drives past. As the car drives towards you, you hear a
higher pitch, as it passes it then changes to a lower pitch.

The goal of this simulation is to show how moving towards or away from a
transmitter (sound or radio waves) causes a change in phase/frequency. This
concept is often demonstrated by showing an image of a car travelling through
waves, and these waves seem to squash at the front of the car and stretch out
at the back. This always confused me as it seemed like the car was having an
impact directly on the waves, where as in reality it is more about relative
frequencies, ie. The receiver receives a different frequency than the
transmitter sent because of the speed the receiver was moving. Not the receiver
"bent" or "distorted" the wave necessarily. If any of that explanation is wrong
please do tell me.

Ps. This was my first time using Bevy so there are probably lots of small things
wrong with this code, but it does indeed work.
